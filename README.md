**Version 1.0** | Released 3 days ago by **Oli-Roc**

Welcome to the Strategic Optimization of Social Welfare (SOW) project! This repository is dedicated to the development and implementation of voting algorithms and applications that adhere to the five criteria of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. We invite developers from around the world to collaborate on creating robust voting procedures that enhance democratic processes and collective decision-making.

## Project Overview

Managing to classify, aggregate, and measure collective preferences is the central subject of study in Social Choice Theory (SCT). For centuries, it was believed that designing a perfect voting system that meets all rationality criteria was impossible, as demonstrated by Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. However, our project provides groundbreaking methodologies to construct decision-making procedures that comply with all five of Arrow's criteria: universality, independence, non-dictatorship, unanimity, and sovereignty.

### Key Contributions

- **Scalable Decision-Making Procedures**: Our methodologies are designed to be scalable and economically deployable across various scales, from small communities to national electoral systems.
- **New Voting Algorithms**: We introduce a set of decision-making procedures that align with Arrow's criteria, promoting both resilience and adaptability.
- **Strategic Goal Alignment**: Our framework includes strategies to build decision-making procedures that align with the strategic goals and values of organizations.
- **Candidate Suitability Analysis**: Provides insights into which types of candidates are best suited for each voting procedure.
- **Wide Range of Applications**: Identifies various fields of application across disciplines, such as economics, political science, and organizational management.

## Why This Project Matters

- **Guidance for Developers**: This repository offers comprehensive documentation and resources to help developers understand and implement voting algorithms that enhance democratic representation.
- **Improving Collective Intelligence**: By developing better voting systems, we aim to strengthen the principles of democracy and improve the functioning of collective intelligence in decision-making processes.
- **Open Source and Free Access**: This knowledge is shared openly to ensure it remains a resource for public benefit and is protected against misappropriation or distortion.

## Installation

To clone the repository and install dependencies, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Oli-Roc/SOW.git
cd SOW
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Our repository contains several example scripts and notebooks demonstrating the use of different voting algorithms:

- **Simple Voting Procedure**: Example of a basic voting system that meets all of Arrow's criteria.
- **Advanced Collective Decision Making**: Demonstrates a more complex procedure suitable for larger datasets and national elections.

To run an example, execute:

```bash
python examples/simple_voting.py
```
